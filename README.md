# Dual-Input CNN for Intent Classification in automated dialogue systems

## Introduction
This repository houses the training code for a Dual-Input Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) aimed at enhancing intent classification within financial conversational AI systems. The model leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of GloVe embeddings alongside the discriminative features extracted through TF-IDF vectorization.

## Model Overview
The Dual-Input CNN architecture merges the strengths of traditional NLP techniques with the latest advancements in deep learning to interpret and classify complex financial queries accurately. This approach ensures a nuanced comprehension of user intents, essential for automated financial advice systems.

## Repository Contents
- `train.py`: The main training script for the Dual-Input CNN model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the training code.
- `config/`: Configuration files defining model parameters and training settings.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## Getting Started
To get started with training your Dual-Input CNN model:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the training script: `python train.py`
